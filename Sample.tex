\end{example}

\begin{investigation}[colbacktitle=myblue]{Opening Problem}
At a junior tournament, some young atheles each throw a discus. The
age and distance thrown are recorded for each athlete.
\begin{center}

Things to think about:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] 

\item Do you think the distance an athlete can throw is related to
the persons age?

\item What happens to the distance thrown as the age of the athlete
increases?

\item How could you graph the data to more clearly see the relationship
between the variables?

\item How can we measure the relationship between the variables?

\end{enumerate}

\begin{assignment}{Hypothesis Testing}

\begin{numedquestion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A random variable $X$ is known to have a normal distribution with
variance $36$. The mean of the distribution of $X$ is denoted by
$\mu$. A random sample of $50$ observations of $X$ has mean $20.2$.
Test, at the $1\%$ significance level, the null hypothesis $\mu=22$
against the alternative hypothesis $\mu\neq22$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{numedquestion}

\begin{numedquestion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A supermarket manager investigated the length of time that customers
spent shopping in the store. The time, $x$ minutes, spent by each
of a random sample of $150$ customers was measured, and it was found that 

\[
\sum x=2871\qquad\sum x^{2}=60\,029
\]

Test at the $5\%$ level of significance, the hypothesis that the
mean time spent shopping by customers is $20$ minutes, against the
alternative that it is less than this. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{numedquestion}

\begin{numedquestion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A coin is chosen at random from a population of recently produced
coins. The discrete random variable $X$ is the age, in years, of
the coin. The population mean of $X$ is denoted by $\mu$, the population standard deviation is denoted by $\sigma$. A random sample of $120$ independent observations of $X$ was taken and the results can be summarised as follows. 
\begin{center}
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}%
\begin{tabular}{|>{\centering}p{2.5cm}|>{\centering}p{1cm}|>{\centering}p{1cm}|>{\centering}p{1cm}|>{\centering}p{1cm}|>{\centering}p{1cm}|>{\centering}p{1cm}|}
\hline 
Age ($x$) & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\tabularnewline
\hline 
Frequency ($f$) & 14 & 26 & 21 & 23 & 17 & 19\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] 

\item  Calculate the values of the unbiased estimates of $\mu$
and $\sigma^{2}$.

\item  The the $5\%$ level of significance, test the null hypothesis
$\mu=2.4$ against the null hypothesis $\mu>2.4$.

\item  Explain whether it is necessary to use the Central Limit Theorem
in your test.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{numedquestion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A company manufactures bottles of iced coffee. Machines $A$ and $B$
are used to fill the bottles with iced coffee.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] 

\item Machine $A$ is set to fill the bottles with $500\,\text{ml}$
of iced coffee. A random sample of $50$ filled bottles was taken
and the volume of iced coffee, $x\,\text{ml}$, in each bottle was
measured. The following data was obtained.

\[
\sum x=24\,965\qquad\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)=365
\]

Calculate the unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance.
Test at the $2\%$ level of significance, whether the mean volume
of iced coffee per bottle is $500\,\text{ml}$. 

\item The company claims that Machine $B$ filled the bottles with
$\mu_{0}\,\text{ml}$ of iced coffee. A random sample of $70$ bottles
was taken and the mean is $489.1\,\text{ml}$ with standard deviation
$4\,\text{ml}$. Find the range of values of $\mu_{0}$ for which
these is sufficient evidence for the company to have overstated the
mean volume at the $2\%$ level of significance.

\end{enumerate}

\end{numedquestion}

\begin{numedquestion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The mass, $x$ kg, of the contents of each packet in a random sample
of $80$ cereal packets is measured, and the results are summarised
by

\[
\sum x=79.53\qquad\sum x^{2}=100.4621
\]

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] 

\item Test, at the $4\%$ significance level, whether the population
mean mass of the contents is less than $1.10\,\text{kg}$.

\item Explain, in the context of the question, the meaning of "at the $4\%$ significance level". 

\end{enumerate}

In another test, using the same data and also at the 4\% significance
level, the hypotheses are as follows.

Null Hypothesis: the population mean mass of the contents is equal
to $\mu_{0}\,\text{kg}$

Alternative hypothesis: the population mean mass of the contents is
not equal to $\mu_{0}\text{ \text{kg}}$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),start=3] 

\item Given that the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of the
alternative hypothesis, find the set of possible values of $\mu_{0}$.

\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{numedquestion}


\begin{numedquestion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
At an early stage in analysing the marks scored by the large number
of candidates in an examination paper, the Examining Board takes a
random sample of $250$ candidates and find that the marks, $x$,
of these candidates give 

\[
\sum x=11\,872\qquad\sum x^{2}=646\,193
\]

Using the figures obtained in this sample, the null hypothesis $\mu=49.5$ is tested against the alternative hypothesis $\mu<49.5$ at the $\alpha\%$ level of significance. Determine the set of values of $\alpha$ for which the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis.

It is subsequently found that the population mean is $45.292$ and
the population standard deviation is $18.761$. Find the probability
of a random sample of size $250$ giving a sample mean at least as
high as the one found in the sample above.
